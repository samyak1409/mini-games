# Mini Games!

Some mini-games I implemented when I was learning python.


## 1. [Prediction Trick](PredictionTrick/Script.py)

- A simple mathematical logic game inspired by a magician on YT.

## 2. [Rock paper scissors](RockPaperScissors/Script.py)

- **Running on PyCharm**- To successfully run this script on PyCharm, go to `Modify Run Configuration...` or `Edit Configuration...` option of the script, then under `Execution` section, enable `Emulate terminal in output console`. <br> 
**Though running this script directly on command line is recommended.**
